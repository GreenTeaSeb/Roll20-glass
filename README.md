# Roll 20 glass theme


Small addon that changes how roll20 looks, there are a few more boxes that are white,
but for players ,it's mostly dark theme now.
For GMs, there's a lot of stuff that isn't tested, and it will look ugly if you use it. 
But I will update it soon so that GMs can use it.

#### CHROME IS CURRENTLY WONKY AND NOT FULLY SUPPORTED
