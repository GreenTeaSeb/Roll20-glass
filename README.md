# Roll 20 glass theme

![Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreenTeaSeb/Roll20-glass/main/src/icon.svg "Icon")


Small addon that changes how roll20 looks, mainly adds a dark mode and some transparency  
there are a few more boxes that are white,  
but for players ,it's mostly dark theme now.  
For GMs, there's a lot of stuff that isn't tested, and it will look ugly if you use it.  
But I will update it soon so that GMs can use it.  

#### `CHROME IS CURRENTLY WONKY AND NOT FULLY SUPPORTED`
