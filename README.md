# Roll 20 glass theme

![Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreenTeaSeb/Roll20-glass/main/src/icon.svg "Icon")


Small addon that changes how roll20 looks, mainly adds a dark mode and some transparency  

Some pages are still white, but those will be fully black soon as well. If you see any white squares, please report it to me and I will fix it.  

For GMs, there's a lot of stuff that isn't tested, and it will look ugly if you use it.  
But I will update it soon so that GMs can use it.  

#### `CHROME IS CURRENTLY WONKY AND NOT FULLY SUPPORTED, YOU MAY EXPERIENCE SOME UNUSUAL VISUAL EFFECTS`
